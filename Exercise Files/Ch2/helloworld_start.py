# Defining a function called main and it only has one statement
# nothing happens when u call this function because you need to call it
def main():
  print "hello world!"
if __name__ == "__main__":
  main()
# line 10 is checking to see if this line of code is loaded __name__ value of main
# therefore this function main should be called.
# helps show the difference when python code is being executed as a library vs program

print "me too"

# indicated lines 9 belongs to function main
# python uses the indentation level of the lines of code to indicate where the code belongs
